### player-count
Small package to retrieve/store/process population data on a *yet to be* large pool of games from a variety of different game publishers.  
Currently, this package does most of the heavy lifting for a batch process (~12000 games) that uses Google Cloud *serverless* functions to run everyday. 
The package requires using MongoDB, and the storage for the batch process is hosted on MongoDBAtlas.  



### Usage
