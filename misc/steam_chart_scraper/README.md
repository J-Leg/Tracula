#### Steam Chart Scraper  
Scrapes all games and the historical player count (monthly) from https://steamcharts.com/  
into MongoDB used for DB.

This is a standalone script.  
Use ```go build``` in this directory, and the executable will be created in this directory.  

Not necessary to use this at all as I have added a DB dump in `/data` to import the data I have collected.
